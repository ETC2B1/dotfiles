Linux is a diverse platform that while it doesn't represent
computing as it is today, it still runs the world and remains
the greatest Kernel and brand of OS. Though, people have been
drumming up more of more talk of it recently. Which is upsetting
as a vast majority of people don't know what it is, how to treat
it, or when/why it's used.

For daily use? Linux is great, the vast issue is the fact that
people have it through their heads that it can be adopted by
average users as a platform for daily use when it simply cannot.
Butchering the platform into a daily work machine for the
average user is the same thing as programming a phone at this
point. I'm going to assume not many people want that for a PC.

People like SomeOrdinaryGamers is a very large advocate
for it though. There is nothing wrong with this other
than the fact that he misconstrues the Kernel for what it is.
People become so blinded that they forget that most of the
Linux downfalls can be bruteforced with hardware power,
something some can afford and a lot of people just simply can't.

A virtual machine isn't a work around or a solution, it's
a way to brute force what you want. Same with Proton/Wine,
unless your someone like me who tinkers with it forever
the average user can't even make it to that point.

For the love of everything math let's be real about it. you
can't get by on Linux without using the terminal, it's
impractical. If you tell people you can then you're setting them
up for failure. The average user needs to be ready and
comforfable to work with the system and not just inside it
