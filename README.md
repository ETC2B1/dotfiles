# dotfiles

These are the dotfile I use across my personal devices, I change
them constantly so check back for new versions if you're into
that sort of thing. I've used many different bits and pieces
of code from several different people. I try to give credit
where it's due in the comments of a file but I can't catch
everything. Feel free to use these in your personal projects
just please, at least keep my comment in the file somewhere.

I've moved onto XMonad as of recent. My colorscheme is horrible
but I'm in love with it. I have a lot of time in StumpWM and
WindowMaker, but the only devices that use those are my
"stationary systems" (systems that are meant to just lay
around for hosting or networking).

I used DWM for a while but I haven't touched it in a bit.
DWM is cool but I don't agree with the people behind it and
their stuff tends to be unstable for the sake of having a small
codebase. That's fine and dandy but it's tedious and horribly
un-modular.
