# dotfiles

These are files I use on my personal machine, use as you wish
I've used several different things from different people, I
lskdjfwould appreciate it if you would at least put a comment in
a file you use from me though.

I currently use DWM but I also use StumpWM and Windowmaker,
a lot of what I have has to do with that. I don't like running
modules or patches I just like modifying the code that is
already present in them.
